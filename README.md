👋 Hi there, I’m Osigah Precious

A Site Reliability & Security Engineer with a strong background in network engineering and security (CCNA, CCNP Security). I specialize in building reliable, secure, and automated infrastructure.

Core Skills

- Python for automation (monitoring, health checks, reporting)

- Cloud & DevOps fundamentals (Docker, CI/CD, infrastructure as code)

- Network & security engineering (Cisco, Huawei, Check Point, firewalls, VPNs)

- Monitoring & observability (PRTG, SolarWinds, open-source tools)

Featured Folders ( Projects that will be added to Portfolio)
- CCNP Labs
- Infrastructure As Code
- Networking Scripts
- Python Projects

<<<<<<< HEAD
I use this space to showcase hands-on projects in automation, cloud reliability, and security engineering bridging my network background with SRE/DevOps practices.
=======
I believe in **learning by doing**, and this repo is a living roadmap of my progress.

## 🧪 Projects & Labs (In Progress)

I’m actively working on hands-on labs and will link each project here as I complete them:

| Project | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `network-automation-labs` | Python scripts to automate switch/router configs and monitoring | ⚙️ In Development |
| `infrastructure-as-code` | Set up microservices and/or websites using Linux servers and vagrant |

Each project folder will have its **own README** with full documentation, usage examples, and setup instructions.
