# 👨🏽‍💻 Osigah's Tech Portfolio

Welcome to my evolving portfolio! I'm a certified network and security engineer transitioning into DevOps, Cloud, and Cybersecurity, blending traditional infrastructure with automation, secure systems design, and cloud-native practices.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm Osigah — a certified network and security professional with:

- ✅ **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)**
- ✅ **Cisco Certified Network Professional – Security (CCNP Security)**
- ✅ **Cisco Security VPN**

Currently, I’m focused on:

- Automating infrastructure with **Python**, **Ansible**, **Docker** and **Bash**
- Building and securing **DevOps pipelines**
- Designing and monitoring **cloud systems (AWS, Azure Devops)**
- Practicing both **offensive and defensive cybersecurity labs**
- Bridging **networking + DevSecOps** in real-world scenarios

I believe in **learning by doing**, and this repo is a living roadmap of my progress.

## 🧪 Projects & Labs (In Progress)

I’m actively working on hands-on labs and will link each project here as I complete them:

| Project | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `network-automation-labs` | Python scripts to automate switch/router configs and monitoring | ⚙️ In Development |
| `infrastructure-as-code` | Set up microservices and/or websites using Linux servers and vagrant |

Each project folder will have its **own README** with full documentation, usage examples, and setup instructions.
